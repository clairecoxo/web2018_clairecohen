                <h1 style="text-align: center;">I really loved this piece, and identified with a lot of the examples he mentioned. As web design has become more and more innovative it feels as if we’ve begun to over simplify. Which leave me to wonder how can we make more inventive design that not only is friendly to the user but expresses something? </h1>
                <h1 style="text-align: center;">I also really appreciated the Tumblr reference and agree that these small nodes of humanity within technology is really interesting and is something i’ve definitely begun to see more frequently. </h1>
