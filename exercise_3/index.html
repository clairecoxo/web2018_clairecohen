<p>There are two kinds of women: those who knit and those who unravel. I am a great unraveler. I can undo years of careful stitching in fifteen gluttonous minutes. It isn’t even a decision, really. Once I see the loose thread, I am undone. It’s over before I have even asked myself the question: Do I actually want to destroy this?<p>

“My mother was a knitter,” my Therapist says. She pauses. We’ve been seeing each other for so many years that we occasionally drift past the doctor/patient boundaries. I know that she is from New Hampshire and was an ice dancer. I know she’s been married for thirty years or so, since her early twenties. Her husband can build a boat. I don’t know anything about her mother.
