        <p>There are two kinds of women: those who knit and those who unravel. I am a great unraveler. I can undo years of careful stitching in fifteen gluttonous minutes. It isn’t even a decision, really. Once I see the loose thread, I am undone. It’s over before I have even asked myself the question: Do I actually want to destroy this?</p>
        <p>“My mother was a knitter,” my Therapist says. She pauses. We’ve been seeing each other for so many years that we occasionally drift past the doctor/patient boundaries. I know that she is from New Hampshire and was an ice dancer. I know she’s been married for thirty years or so, since her early twenties. Her husband can build a boat. I don’t know anything about her mother.</p>
        <p>Maybe it’s the unseasonably mild November weather, or that her hair has grown back and she’s not wearing a wig and she looks like herself again, but she continues.</p>
        <p>“I have a story about knitting.” She glances at the clock to my right.</p>
        <p>“That’s wonderful because I have to write this thing about knitting. And knitting is like, a whole metaphor thing.”</p>
        <p>“A metaphor for what?”</p>
        <p>“I think for life and fate. Also comfort. For love. For the divine feminine?”</p>
        <p>She smiles and waits.</p>
        <p>“So, I don’t know yet. But it’s one huge metaphor,” I say finally</p>
