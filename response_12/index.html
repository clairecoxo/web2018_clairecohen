                <h1 style="text-align: center;">“In  other  words, it  is  no  longer  possible  to  regard  the  contemporary  work  as  a  space  to  be  walked  through  (the “owner's  tour"  is  akin  to  the  collector's).  It  is  henceforth  presented  as  a  period  of  time  to  be  lived through,  like  an  opening  to  unlimited  discussion. “
I found this point really interesting—this point to me really harkens on the point of how context is important to any body of work we are trying to gain a better understanding of. </h1>
                <h1 style="text-align: center;">I loved the idea of art as a place in which we communicate, but I think this also plays in accessibility. Which remind me of how the MET recently started making visitors who are not NYC residents pay to visit—it’s a conundrum because although it would be nice for establishments such as the MET to remain free it’s also difficult for them to maintain themselves if they are, as we’ve seen happen. But this allows then for the museum to become a place only visited by those who can afford to visit. </h1>
