        <p><i>Why You Can Judge a Book by its Cover:</i><br>
           For a moment, I’m going to marry my interests: writing and design. I have an obsession with well designed books and sincerely believe that the saying: “you can’t judge a book by its cover” is incredibly false. Here is my theory: stronger illustrations and design usually come with a bigger budget which means that the publisher believes more in the work that they are publishing since they are allocating a larger amount of funds to create not only a literary piece that stands ground but one that is visually intriguing. Although not all great books are  ascetically pleasing, a classic is a classic. If we think back to older book cover they are simple and usually contain only pertinent information (this also means they age really well vs. other books that look “trendy’).  My personal experience is that because I tend to be a bit more visual, it’s really difficult to buy books that seem incredible if they look horrible (I realize this is an awful thing to say) although I do sometimes give in. I'm mostly thinking of the more niche books (more specifically this one I read on how trees communicate, awful design highly interesting read.) I guess it's really a toss up—I would understand if someone found the cover distracting. Curious to hear anyones opinion though, any thoughts?</p>
