                <h1 style="text-align: center;">It’s was really interesting to think about the point the author makes about how good content is the measure of good design. Which lead me to wondering how bad design informs good content, there are certain websites and articles I can’t read unless the design that surrounds them speaks to their content. </h1>
                <h1 style="text-align: center;">How do we inform our reader visually without distracting them by the design? How can designers work on the idea of trust (since the design of a website usually informs your opinion of it in some sense) within journalism?</h1>
